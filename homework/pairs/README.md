# Task description
Please write a script which prints pairs of numbers if their sum is equal to a given number for a given collection of numbers.
For instance, if python pairs.py 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 is executed, the following is printed:
```
3 + 7
4 + 6
5 + 5
```
Please take into account, that the logic of calculation has to be defined outside main block.
Assume that all arguments (if any) are valid numbers (exception handling will be covered later in the course).
